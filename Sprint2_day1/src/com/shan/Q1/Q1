Q1) Differentiate between static and non-static variables.
		* Static variables are the variables that have the static keyword in front of it and,
		  also can be accessed inside any method inside the class.
		* Static variables can be accessed inside the main method because they will be stored on the 
		  RAM at the time of compilation can be accessed by the CPU at the execution phase.
		
		* Non-static variables are the variables which is just assigned as instance variable inside the class,
		  if we want to access the non-static variables inside the main method we need to create the obj of that instance.
		* The non-static variables are stored in the hard disk but not in the RAM so it can not be fetched by the main method
		  at the time of execution so we are creating an obj of the class so it will create a new space in the HEAP which will
		  store all the non-static variables inside that and can be used by the main method through the obj
