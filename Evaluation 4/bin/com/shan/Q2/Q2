Q2) Explain about Hashcode and Equals Method.


	Hashcode :
   * Hashcode method is used to generate a random hashcode value to an object and it returns the interger value for the given object.
   * It is also used to check ehether the objects entered are equal or not.
   * it also has a contract with equals method so wherever we use hashcode equals method shouls also be overridden.
   
   Equals :   
   * Equals methos is also used to check whether the inserted object in a set is equal or not.
   * Since set does not allow duplicate element we need to check manually when we enter any user-defined datas like objects.
   * It will override the eqquals and checks and returns the value so that using these two methods we can identify if any dulpicate elements 
     are presenteed or not.
