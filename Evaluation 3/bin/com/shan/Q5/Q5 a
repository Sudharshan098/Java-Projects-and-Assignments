a) Does the below code compile successfully? If not, why?
		interface A{
		int i = 111;
		}
		class B implements A{
		void methodB(){
		i = 222;
		}
		}
		
		
	Answer:
	      No, the code will not execute successfully because any variables that are assigned in the Interface 
	      are denoted as final and it cannot be modified in the implemented class.
	      
	      The implemented class can use any of the methods which are in the A interface but cannot modified the final instance
	      variables such as int i=111;
