Question 2:

    Briefly explain the difference between Early and Late Binding with examples.
    
    Early Binding 
          * The word binding refers to the bonding between the method body and method call. When the method body and the method call executed
            during the Compile time is called the Early binding.
         
          * It's also called Static Polymorphism.
          
          * Early binding shows the errors in the project before compilation so we can identify the error and correct it before running it.
          
          * If a compiler knows which method to call up during the compilation time its called an Early binding.
    
    Late Binding
          * The word binding refers to the bonding between, its method body and method call. When the method body and the method call executed
            during the Run time its called the Late binding.
		  
		  *	Its also called a Dynamic Polymorphism. 
		  
		  * If compiler doesn't know which method to call up until the run time its called a Late binding.
